Python implementation of the graph anonymity algorithm described in [1,2]

If you use this code, please cite the paper above.

The core of our algorithm is based on the implementation of the Szemeredi regularity lemma provided by Fiorucci et al. and available at https://github.com/MarcoFiorucci/graph-summarization-using-regular-partitions (modifications of the original algorithm of Fiorucci et al. have been highlighted in the code)
